This repository contains some scripts and a package related to running and 
analyzing Gaussian calculations (and possibly a little for Q-Chem). 
There is also some older code for looking at the convergence of metadynamics
calculations run with PLUMED.

There was previously a script to help setup parallel tempering calculations,
but that was removed because a newer version is available in 
[ParaTemp](https://github.com/theavey/ParaTemp).
